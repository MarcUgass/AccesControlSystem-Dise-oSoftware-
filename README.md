# Access Control System

An access control system (ACS) is a form of physical security that manages
who has access to an area at any given time. Access control systems restrict
access to authorized users and provide a means to keep track of who enters
and leaves secured areas.
It includes the implementation of electrified doors, turnstiles, guards and
gates to keep an area secure. In an access controlled-building, authorized
persons use credentials (physical, digital via a mobile device, or biometric)
to make unlock requests at readers, which send information to an Access
Control Unit (ACU). The ACU then triggers the electrified door hardware
to unlock if authorized1
.
Many sectors benefit from access control: multi-tenant houses, retail
shops, hospitals and healthcare institutions, government facilities, airports,
companies with secured areas like oil and gas facilities and data centers
etc. Examples of commercial cloud-based access control systems are Aviglion
Alta, Kisi, SALTO Systems and ProDataKey.
Modern ACS have the two following key characteristics: 1) they can work
with credentials embedded in smartphones and 2) the ACU is in the cloud.
